## What it does

AirCursor reads the motion sensors already built into your AirPods and turns head movement into a smooth, precise pointer. It runs as a native menu bar app. There's no extra hardware, no camera, and no account.

| You do | AirCursor does *(defaults, all remappable)* |
|---|---|
| Turn your head | Moves the pointer (smooth, accelerated, works across all your displays) |
| Rest the pointer on a button | **Hover click.** A ring fills, then it clicks. Only buttons, links, tabs, menus, fields and Dock icons count, so resting on text you're reading never clicks |
| Press the stem once | Left click |
| Press the stem twice | Right click |
| Press the stem three times | Scroll mode: look up/down/left/right to scroll |
| Nod | Left click, landing where you pointed *before* the nod |
| Shake your head | Pause / resume |
| Tilt left / right | Your choice: Back/Forward, switch Spaces, Mission Control… |

Other actions you can assign: double click, middle click, drag lock, recenter, App windows, the screenshot tool, and more. Shortcuts: **⌃⌥T** pause · **⌃⌥S** scroll mode · **⌃⌥C** recenter · **⌃⌥D** drag.

### A one-minute guided tour

On first launch AirCursor takes you through two permissions and connecting your AirPods, then has you **try it once for real**: point at a button with your head and hold still until it clicks, or nod. While you do that, it learns how big your natural nod is and tunes nod detection to match. A 3D pair of earbuds mirrors your head in real time the whole way through. If you leave for System Settings to grant a permission, the tour comes back and resumes on the same step.

## Reading Mode (development preview)

Reading Mode adds steady vertical scrolling and explicit forward/back steps.
Enter with **⌃⌥R** or choose **Reading** in the menu. Close the menu, focus your
document and place the pointer over it; press **⌃⌥P** to start or pause.
**⌃⌥N** steps forward and **⌃⌥B** goes back; both leave scrolling paused.
Adjust speed and step distance in Settings. These are scroll distances, not exact
text lines or pages.

While reading, single/double/triple stem presses start or pause/go back/exit.
Tilt left/right to decrease/increase speed. Shake to pause; shake again while
paused to exit. Nods, hover clicks and normal click/drag actions are ignored.
Your normal gesture bindings return on exit. Stem controls must be enabled and
may conflict with media playback; the shortcuts remain available.

Manual input, pointer movement, switching apps and interrupted motion pause the
session. Resume explicitly over your document. This preview checks the foreground
app and pointer position; it does not lock to a particular window or nested pane.
macOS compilation, input-monitor behavior and real-AirPods validation are pending;
see [the implementation plan](docs/READING_MODE_PLAN.md) before release.

## Requirements


- macOS 15 Sequoia or later (Apple silicon or Intel)
- Headphones with head-tracking sensors: **AirPods Pro** (any generation), **AirPods Max**, **AirPods (3rd generation or later)**, or **Beats Fit Pro**

## Install

1. **[Download AirCursor.zip](https://github.com/m-afham/AirCursor/releases/latest/download/AirCursor.zip)** (always the latest version), unzip it, and move **AirCursor** to Applications.
2. Open it. If macOS says it can't verify the developer, open **System Settings › Privacy & Security**, scroll down, and click **Open Anyway**. (Only needed for builds that aren't notarized.)
3. Follow the guided tour.

### Build from source

```bash
git clone https://github.com/m-afham/AirCursor.git && cd AirCursor
make install     # builds a universal app, copies it to /Applications, launches it
```

`make run` builds and launches without installing. `make test` runs the unit tests. Building needs Xcode 16 or later.

### Uninstall

1. Quit AirCursor from its menu bar icon (**Quit**).
2. Delete **AirCursor** from Applications.
3. Optional: remove its settings and permissions:
   ```bash
   defaults delete io.github.m-afham.AirCursor
   tccutil reset All io.github.m-afham.AirCursor
   ```

## Permissions & privacy

| Permission | Why |
|---|---|
| Accessibility | To move the pointer, click and scroll for you |
| Motion | To read head movement from your AirPods |
| Bluetooth | To list, pair and connect your headphones |

Motion data is processed in memory on your Mac and never stored or sent anywhere. AirCursor has no analytics. Its only network requests are a once-a-day check of this repository's latest release on GitHub, so it can tell you when an update is out, and downloading the update when you click **Install & Relaunch**. They carry nothing about you, your Mac or how you use the app, and you can turn it off in **Settings › Shortcuts & General › Updates**.

## Updating

AirCursor tells you when a new version is out and shows what's new. Click **Install & Relaunch** and it downloads the update, checks that it's a genuine signed AirCursor release, replaces itself and restarts. macOS then asks you to switch AirCursor off and on once in **System Settings › Privacy & Security › Accessibility**, and the guided tour opens right at that step. (Versions before 1.0.5 can't check for updates, so download the latest once from the link above.)

## Troubleshooting

**The pointer doesn't move.** AirPods only send head-tracking data to the device they're *playing audio for*. If your iPhone has them, or your Mac's sound output is set to its speakers, no motion arrives. Put the AirPods in, then choose them under **Control Center › Sound**. AirCursor switches the Mac's output to your AirPods automatically when it can, and warns you when it can't.

**After updating from 1.0.6 or earlier, the pointer doesn't move even though Accessibility is on.** Those versions were signed per build, and macOS keeps the old build's permission. Switching it off and on doesn't fix that. Open **System Settings › Privacy & Security › Accessibility**, select AirCursor, remove it with the **−** button, then click **Open Settings** in AirCursor's guided tour and switch it on again. Releases from 1.0.7 on share one signing identity, so permissions carry over to later updates.

**Something else is off.** Open **Settings › Shortcuts & General › Diagnostics**. It checks every link in the chain (permissions, Bluetooth, audio route, motion samples) and marks the first one that's failing.

**Hover click is too fast, too slow, or clicks things I didn't mean to.** Go to **Settings › Clicks & Gestures › Hover click** to change the rest time, or turn it off. It pauses while you type, and it only clicks things macOS reports as clickable.

**Nods don't click, or click by accident.** Go to **Settings › Clicks & Gestures** and adjust **Nod size needed**. The hint underneath shows how big your last nod was. Replaying the guided tour also re-tunes it automatically.

**Stem presses play/pause my music instead.** macOS sends AirPods presses to the "Now Playing" app. AirCursor claims that role while tracking, but if music is playing in another app, that app may win. Head gestures always work.

**Removing an AirPod clicks.** Taking one out sends "pause", which counts as a stem press. Pause tracking first (shake or ⌃⌥T), or turn off Automatic Ear Detection.

## How it works

```
CMHeadphoneMotionManager (~25 Hz attitude)
   → MotionDifferentiator      angular rates (deg/s), wrap-around + gap safe
   → GestureDetector           nod / shake / tilt (direction-agnostic, with cooldown)
   → PointerMapper             dead zone + sensitivity + bounded acceleration → px/s
   → PointerSmoother (120 Hz)  frame-rate-independent easing; stops when samples go stale
   → EventSynthesizer          CGEvent move / click / drag / scroll / keys
MPRemoteCommandCenter          stem presses (play/pause, next, previous) → triggers
```

- **Relative (velocity) mapping.** The pointer follows how fast you turn your head, not your absolute head angle. Nothing to calibrate, and no drift.
- **Gestures don't move your target.** Recent pointer positions are buffered. When a nod or shake is recognized, the click lands where you were pointing when the gesture began.
- **Your mouse still works.** Move a real mouse or trackpad and AirCursor picks up from the new position.
- **Safe by default.** A held drag is released on pause, disconnect, stalled motion or sleep.

The pointer and gesture core (`Sources/AirCursorCore`) is plain Swift with unit tests. See [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) for a tour of the code.
